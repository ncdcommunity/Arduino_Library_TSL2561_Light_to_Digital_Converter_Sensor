How to Use the TSL2561 Arduino Library

The TSL2561 has a number of settings, which can be configured based on user requirements.
          
1.Gain setting:The following command is used to set the gain of sensor.

              tsl.setGain(GAIN_16X);                                  // 16X
            
2.Integration time setting:The following command is used to set the integration time.

             tsl.setIntegTime(INTEGRATIONTIME_13_7MS);               // 13.7 ms
